** Gnus changes.

*** The Gnus alpha distribution no longer bundles Custom and Widget.
If your Emacs doesn't come with these libraries, fetch them from
<URL:http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/>.  You also then need to
add the following to the lisp/dgnushack.el file:

     (push "~/lisp/custom" load-path)

Modify to suit your needs.

*** New functionality for using Gnus as an offline newsreader has been
added.  A plethora of new commands and modes have been added.  See the
Gnus manual for the full story.

*** The nndraft backend has returned, but works differently than
before.  All Message buffers are now also articles in the nndraft
group, which is created automatically.

*** `gnus-alter-header-function' can now be used to alter header
values.

*** `gnus-summary-goto-article' now accept Message-ID's.

*** A new Message command for deleting text in the body of a message
outside the region: `C-c C-v'.
