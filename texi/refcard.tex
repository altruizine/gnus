{\bf\LARGE (ding) Gnus Reference Card\\}
{\normalsize for version 0.98}
\end{center}

Gnus is complex. Currently it has some 346 interactive (user-callable)
functions. Of these 279 have keybindings in the two major modes (Group and
Summary/Article). Of these functions, 96 have more than one binding; some
have 3 or even 4 bindings. The total number of keybindings is 389. In order
to save 40\% space, every function is listed only once, under the ``more
logical'' binding. Alternative bindings are given in parentheses in the
beginning of the description.

Many Gnus commands are affected by the numeric prefix. Normally you enter a
prefix by holding the Meta key and typing a number, but in most Gnus modes
you don't need to use Meta since the digits are not self-inserting. The
prefixed behavior of commands is given in [brackets]. Often the prefix is
used to specify:

\quad [distance] How many objects to move the point over.

\quad [scope] How many objects to operate on (including the current one).

\quad [p/p] The ``Process/Prefix Convention'': If a prefix is specified
then it determines how many objects to operate on. Else if there are some
objects marked with the process mark \#, these are operated on. Else only
the current object is affected.

\quad [level] A group subscribedness level. Only groups with a lower or
equal level will be affected by the operation. If no prefix is given,
`gnus-group-default-list-level' is used.  If
`gnus-group-use-permanent-levels', then a prefix to the `g' and `l'
commands will also set the default level.

\quad [score] An article score. If no prefix is given,
`gnus-summary-default-score' is used.

Some functions were not yet documented at the time of creating this
reference card and are clearly indicated as such.

\subsection*{Extract Series (Uudecode etc)}
Gnus will recognize when the current article is part of a series (multipart
posting whose parts are identified by numbers in their subjects, e.g.\
1/10\dots10/10) and will process the series accordingly. You can mark more
than one series. If the posting contains any archives, they are expanded
and gathered in a new group.\\*
\begin{keys}
X b     & Un-{\bf b}inhex these series. [p/p]\\
X o     & Simply {\bf o}output these series (no decoding). [p/p]\\

X s     & Un-{\bf s}har these series. [p/p]\\
X u     & {\bf U}udecode these series. [p/p]\\
\end{keys}

Each one of these commands has four variants:\\*

X   \bf z & Decode these series. [p/p]\\
X v \bf z & Decode and view these series. [p/p]\\
X   \bf Z & Decode and save these series. [p/p]\\
X v \bf Z & Decode, save and view these series. [p/p]\\
\end{keys}
where {\bf z} identifies the decoding method (b, o ,p ,s, u).
