news can be gotten by any nefarious means you can think of - NNTP, local
spool, mail spool.  All at the same time, if you want to push your luck.

@node History
@chapter History

GNUS was written by Masanobu UMEDA.  When autumn crept up in '94, Lars
Ingebrigtsen grew bored and decided to write (ding) Gnus.

(ding) Gnus is based on GNUS 4.1 and includes bits and pieces by Felix
Lee and jwz.

The recommended pronounciation of the name this program is "ding
guh-noose", with "ding" being half-sung in a loud, high-pitched voice,
and "guh-noose" being grumbled and a disaffected fashion.  Any irritation
and/or damage this name may cause you is not the responsibility of the
author, even though you might like to strangle him for the stupid idea.

"(ding)", is, of course, short for "Ding Is Not Gnus", which is a total
and utter lie, but who cares? (Besides, the "Gnus" in this abbreviation
should probably be pronounced "news" as UMEDA intended, which makes it a
more appropriate name, don't you think?)

@menu
* Compatibility::          Just how compatible is (ding) Gnus with GNUS?
* New Features::           A short description of all the new stuff in Gnus.
@end menu

@node Compatibility
@section Compatibility

(ding) Gnus was designed to be fully compatible with GNUS.  Almost all
key binding have been kept.  More key binding have been added, of course,
but only in one or two obscure cases have key bindings been changed.

All commands have kept their names.  Some internal functions have changed
their names.

Even though old methods of doing things are still supported, only the
new methods are documented in this manual.  If you detect a new method of
doing something while reading this manual, that does not mean you have
to stop doing it the old way.

(ding) Gnus understands all GNUS startup files.

@kindex M-x gnus-bug
Overall, a casual user who hasn't written much code that depends on GNUS
internals should suffer no problems.  If problems occur, please let me
know (@kbd{M-x gnus-bug}).

However, code that depends on the buffers looking a particular way will
almost invaribaly fail.  For instance, the Summary buffer does not
display article numbers by default.

@node New Features
@section New Features

The look of all buffers can be changed by setting format-like variables.
 
Local spool and several NNTP servers can be used at once.  Virtual
newsgroups and private mail newsgroups are featured.

Killing can be done on arbitrary headers.

Gnus can generate dummy roots for threads that have lost their roots
(thereby gathering loose sub-threads in one thread) or it can go back
and retrieve enough headers to build a complete thread.

Killed groups can be displayed in the Newsgroup buffer, and you can read
them as well.

Gnus can do partial updates of new articles - you do not have to
retrieve the entire active file just to check for new articles in a few
groups.

Gnus implements a sliding scale of subscribedness to newsgroups.

Gnus can sort the displayed headers of articles.

@node Starting Up
@chapter Starting Gnus

@kindex M-x gnus
If your systems administrator has set thing up properly, starting Gnus
and reading news is extremely easy - you just type @kbd{M-x gnus}.

If things do not go smoothly at startup, you have to twiddle some
variables. 

@menu
* Finding the News::    Choosing a method for getting news.
* First Time::          What does Gnus do the first time you start it?
* New Newsgroups::      What is Gnus supposed to do with new newsgroups?
* Startup Files::       Those pesky startup files - @file{.newsrc}.
* Auto Save::           Recovering from a crash.
* The Active File::     Reading the active file over a slow line Takes Time.
* Startup Variables::   Other variables you might change.
@end menu

@node Finding the News
@section Finding the News

@vindex gnus-default-select-method
The @code{gnus-default-select-method} variable controls how Gnus finds
news.  This variable should be a list where the first element says "how"
and the second element says "where".

For instance, if you want to get your daily dosage of news from the NNTP
server "news.friendly.server", you'd say:

@example
(setq gnus-default-select-method '(nntp "news.friendly.server"))
@end example

If you want to use a local spool, say:

@example
(setq gnus-default-select-method '(nnspool ""))
@end example

If this variable is not set, Gnus will take a look at the
@code{NNTPSERVER} environment variable.  If that isn't set either, it
will try to use the machine that is running Emacs as an NNTP server.

@vindex gnus-secondary-servers
You can also make Gnus prompt you interactively for the name of an NNTP
server.  If you give a non-numerical prefix to `gnus' (ie. `C-u M-x
gnus'), Gnus will let you choose between the servers in the
@code{gnus-secondary-servers} variable (if any).  You can also just type
in the name of any server you feel like visiting.

However, if you use one NNTP server regularly, and is just interested in
a couple of newsgroups from a different server, you would be better
served by using the @code{gnus-group-browse-foreign-server} command from
the Newsgroup buffer.  It will let you have a look at what groups are
available, and you can subscribe to any of the groups you want to.  This
also makes @file{.newsrc} maintenance much tidier.

@node First Time
@section The First Time

One time has to be the first, but it doesn't have to be painful.

If no startup files exist, Gnus will try to determine what newsgroups
should be subscribed by default.

@vindex gnus-default-subscribed-newsgroups
If the variable @code{gnus-default-subscribed-newsgroups} is set, Gnus
will subscribe you to just those newsgroups in that list, leaving the
rest killed.  Your systems administrator should have set this variable to
something useful.

Since he hasn't, Gnus will ask the NNTP server (if you use one) if it
has any idea. 

If that fails as well, Gnus will just subscribe you to a few randomly
picked newsgroups (ie. @samp{*.newusers}).

If @code{gnus-default-subscribed-newsgroups} is t, Gnus will just use
the normal functions for treating new newsgroups, and not do anything
special.

@node New Newsgroups
@section New Newsgroups

@vindex gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-method
What Gnus does when it encounters a new newsgroup is determined by the
@code{gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-method} variable.

This variable should contain a function.  Some handy ready-made values
are:

@table @code
@item gnus-subscribe-randomly
@vindex gnus-subscribe-randomly
Subscribe all new newsgroups randomly.

@item gnus-subscribe-alphabetically
@vindex gnus-subscribe-alphabetically
Subscribe all new newsgroups alphabetically.

@item gnus-subscribe-hierarchically
@vindex gnus-subscribe-hierarchically
Subscribe all new newsgroups hierarchially.

@item gnus-subscribe-interactively
@vindex gnus-subscribe-interactively
Subscribe new newsgroups interactively.  This means that Gnus will ask
you about *all* new newsgroups.

@item gnus-subscribe-zombies
@vindex gnus-subscribe-zombies
Make all new newsgroups zombies.  You can browse the zombies later and
either kill them off properly or subscribe to them.  This is the
default. 

@end table

@vindex gnus-subscribe-hierarchical-interactive
A closely related variable is
@code{gnus-subscribe-hierarchical-interactive}.  If this variable is
non-nil, Gnus will ask you in a hierarchial fashion whether to subscribe
to new newsgroups or not.  Gnus will ask you for each sub-hierarchy
whether you want to descend the hierarchy or not. 

@vindex gnus-check-new-newsgroups
If you are satisfied that you never really want to see any new
newsgroups, you could set @code{gnus-check-new-newsgroups} to
nil.  This will also save you some time at startup.  Even if this
variable is nil, you can always subscribe to the new newsgroups
by just pressing @kbd{U} in the @dfn{Newsgroup buffer}.

@node Startup Files
@section Startup Files

Now, you all know about the @file{.newsrc} files.  All information about
what newsgroups you read is traditionally stored in this file, which has
a rather rigid structure.

Things got a bit more complicated with GNUS.  In addition to keeping the
@file{.newsrc} file updated, it also used a file called @file{.newsrc.el} for
storing all the information that didn't fit into the @file{.newsrc}
file.  (Actually, it duplicated everything in the @file{.newsrc} file.)
GNUS would read whichever one of these files that were the most recently
saved, which enabled people to swap between GNUS and other newsreaders.

That was kinda silly, so (ding) Gnus went one better: In addition to the
@file{.newsrc} and @file{.newsrc.el} files, (ding) Gnus also has a file
called @file{.newsrc.eld}.  It will read whichever of these files that
are most recent, but it will never write a @file{.newsrc.el} file. 

@vindex gnus-save-newsrc-file
You can also turn off writing @file{.newsrc} by setting
@code{gnus-save-newsrc-file} to nil, which means you can delete
the file and save some space, as well as some time when quitting
Gnus.  However, that will make it impossible to use other newsreaders
than (ding) Gnus.  But hey, who would want to, right? 

@vindex gnus-save-killed-list
If @code{gnus-save-killed-list} is nil, Gnus will not save the list of
killed groups to the startup file.  This will save both time (when
starting and quitting) and space (on disk).  It will also means that Gnus
has no record of what newsgroups are new or old, so the automatic new
newsgroups subscription methods become meaningless.  You should always
set `gnus-check-new-newsgroups' to nil if you set this variable to
nil.

@vindex gnus-startup-file
The @code{gnus-startup-file} variable says where the startup files
are.  The default value is @file{"~/.newsrc"}, with the Gnus (El Dingo)
startup file being whatever that one is with a @samp{".eld"} appended.

@vindex gnus-save-newsrc-hook
@code{gnus-save-newsrc-hook} is called before saving the @file{.newsrc}
file. 

@node Auto Save
@section Auto Save

Whenever you do something that changes the Gnus data (reading articles,
cathing up, killing/subscribing to newsgroups,) the change is added to a
special @dfn{dribble} buffer.  This buffer is auto-saved the normal Emacs
way.

If Gnus detects this file at startup, it will ask the user whether to
read it.

The auto save file is deleted whenever the real startup file is saved. 

@node The Active File
@section The Active File

When Gnus starts, or indeed whenever it tries to determine if new
articles has arrived, it reads the active file.  This is a file stored on
the NNTP server or in the local spool. 

@vindex gnus-ignored-newsgroups
Before examining the active file to see what newsgroups are available,
Gnus deletes all lines in this file that match
@code{gnus-ignored-newsgroups}.  You may even use this variable to make
Gnus ignore hierarchies you aren't interested in.

@vindex gnus-read-active-file
The active file can be rather Huge, so if you have a slow network, you
can set @code{gnus-read-active-file} to nil to prevent Gnus from reading
the entire active file.

Gnus will try to make do by just getting information on the newsgroups
that you actually subscribe to.

Note that if you subscribe to lots and lots of newsgroups, setting this
variable to nil will probabaly make Gnus slower, not faster.



@node Startup Variables
@section Startup Variables

@table @code
@item gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups
@vindex gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups
If non-nil, Gnus will check for and delete all bogus newsgroups at
startup.  A @dfn{bogus newsgroup} is a newsgroup that you have in you
@file{.newsrc} file, but doesn't exist on the news server.  Checking for
bogus newsgroups isn't very quick, so to save time and resources, it's
best to leave this option off, and instead do the checking for bogus
newsgroups once in a while from the Newsgroup buffer.
@item gnus-inhibit-startup-message
@vindex gnus-inhibit-startup-message
If non-nil, the startup message won't be displayed.  That way, nobody will
notice thay you are reading news instead of doing your job.
@end table

@node The Newsgroup Buffer
@chapter The Newsgroup Buffer

The @dfn{Newsgroup buffer} lists all (or parts) of the available
newsgroups and displays various information regarding these groups. 
It is the first buffer displayed when Gnus starts.

@menu
* Newsgroup Buffer Format::  Information listed and how you can change it.
* Newsgroup Manouvering::    Commands for moving in the newsgroup buffer.
* Selecting a Newsgroup::    Actually reading news.
* Newsgroup Subscribing::    Unsubscribing, killing, subscribing.

@end menu

@node Newsgroup Buffer Format
@section Newsgroup Buffer Format

The default format of the Newsgroup buffer is nice and dull, but you can
make it as exciting and ugly as you feel like.

Here's a couple of example newsgroup lines:

@example
     25: news.announce.newusers
 *    3: alt.fan.andrea-dworkin
@end example

Quite simple, huh?

Those lines mean that there are 25 unread articles in
@samp{news.announce.newusers} and 3 marked articles in
@samp{alt.fan.andrea-dworkin} and no unread artcles (see that little
asterisk at the beginning of the line?)

@vindex gnus-group-line-format
You can fuck that up to your hearts delight by fiddling with the
@code{gnus-group-line-format} variable.  This variable works along the
lines of a @code{format} specification, which is pretty much the same as
a @code{printf} specifications, for those of you who use (feh!) C.

One extension is that specifications like @samp{%7,12s} is allowed,
which means that the field will be at least 7 characters long, and no
more that 12 characters long.

The default value that produced those lines above is 
@samp{"%M%S%5N: %G\n"}.

There should always be a colon on the line; the cursor is always moved
to the colon.  Nothing else is required - not even the newsgroup name. 

Here's a list of all available format characters:

@table @samp
@item M    
Only marked articles
@item S
Whether the group is subscribed 
@item L    
Level of subscribedness 
@item N
Number of unread articles
@item G
Group name 
@item m
Number of marked articles 
@item T
Total number of articles; both read and unread 
@item D
Newsgroup description
@item s
Select method 
@item n
Select from where
@item z
A string that look like @samp{<%s:%n>} if a foreign select method is
used. 
@end table

@vindex gnus-group-mode-line-format
The mode line can also be changed by using the
@code{gnus-group-mode-line-format} variable.  It does not understand that
many format specifiers:

@table @samp
@item S
Default news server
@item M
Default select method
@end table

@node Newsgroup Manouvering
@section Newsgroup Manouvering

All movement commands understand the numeric prefix and will behave as
expected, hopefully. 

@table @kbd

@vindex gnus-large-newsgroup
The @code{gnus-large-newsgroup} variable says what Gnus considers to be
a "big" newsgroup.  If the newsgroup is big, Gnus will query the user
before entering the newsgroup.  The user can then specify how many
articles should be fetched from the server.  If the user specifies a
negative number (@samp{-n}), the @samp{n} articles that have arrived
most recently will be fetched.  If it is positive, the @samp{n} oldest
articles will be fetched.

@vindex gnus-auto-select-newsgroup
If @code{gnus-auto-select-newsgroup} is non-nil, the first unread
article in the newsgroup will be displayed when you enter the
newsgroup.  If you want to prevent automatic selection in some newsgroup
(say, in a binary newsgroup with Huge articles) you can set til variable
to nil in `gnus-select-group-hook', which is called when a newsgroup is
selected.  This hook is also popularly used for sorting headers before
generating the Summary buffer.

@end table

@node Newsgroup Levels
@section Newsgroup Levels

All newsgroups have a level of "subscribedness".  For instance, if a
newsgroup is on level 2, it is "more" subscribed than a newsgroup on
level 5.  You can ask Gnus to just list newsgroups on a given level and
lower, or to just check new articles in newsgroups on a given level and
lower, etc. 

@table @kbd
@item s
@kindex s (Group)
@findex gnus-group-set-current-level
Set the level of the current newsgroup depending on the numeric
prefix.  For instance, @kbd{3 s} will set the level of the current
newsgroup to three (@code{gnus-group-set-current-level}).
@end table

Gnus considers groups on levels 1-5 to be subscribed, 6-7 to be
unsubscribed, 8 to be zombies (walking dead) and 9 to be killed,
completely dead.  Gnus treats subscribed and unsubscribed groups exactly
the same, but zombie and killed groups have no information on what
articles you have read, etc, stored.

@vindex gnus-keep-same-level
If @code{gnus-keep-same-level} is non-nil, some movement commands will
only move to groups that are of the same level (or lower).  In
particular, going from the last article in one newsgroup to the next
newsgroup will go to the next newsgroup of the same level (or
lower).  This might be handy if you want to read the most important
newsgroups before you read the rest.

@node Foreign Newsgroups
@section Foreign Newsgroups

A @dfn{foreign newsgroup} is a newsgroup that is not read by the usual
(or default) means.  It could be, for instance, a newsgroup from a
different NNTP server, it could be a virtual newsgroup or it could be a
"newsgroup" of your own personal mail.

@table @kbd
@item M-a
@kindex M-a (Group)
@findex gnus-group-add-newsgroup
Add a new newsgroup.  Gnus will prompt you for a name, a method and an
"address" (@code{gnus-group-add-newsgroup}).
@item M-e
@kindex M-e (Group)
@findex gnus-group-edit-newsgroup
Edit a newsgroup entry.  Gnus will pop up a new buffer where you can edit
the entry (@code{gnus-group-edit-newsgroup}). 
@end table

The different methods all have their peculiarities, of course.

@menu
* nntp::           Reading news from a different NNTP server
* nnspool::        Reading news from the local spool
* nnvirtual::      Combining articles from many newsgroups
* Mail::           Reading your personal mail with Gnus
@end menu

@vindex gnus-activate-foreign-newsgroups
If the @code{gnus-activate-foreign-newsgroups} is t, Gnus will
check all foreign newsgroup at startup.  This might take quite a while,
especially if you subscribe to lots of groups from different NNTP
servers.  It is @code{nil} by default, which means that you won't be told
whether there are new articles in these groups.  How many unread articles
there are will be determined when, or if, you decide to enter them.

@node nntp
@subsection nntp

Subscribing to a foreign group from an NNTP server is rather easy.  You
just specify @code{nntp} as method and the address of the NNTP server as
the, uhm, address. 

The name of the foreign newsgroup can be the same as a native
newsgroup.  However, two foreign newsgroup can not have the same names. 

@node nnspool
@subsection nnspool

Subscribing to a foreign group from the local spool is extremely easy,
even though I don't see quite why you'd want to.  If you have a local
spool, why don't you use that as the default method?

Anyways, you just specify @code{nnspool} as the method and @samp{""} as
the address.

@node nnvirtual
@subsection nnvirtual

A @dfn{virtual newsgroup} is really nothing more than a collection of
other newsgroups. 

You specify @code{nnvirtual} as the method and a regular expression that
says which newsgroups that you wish to have in this one as the address. 

For instance, if you are tired of reading many small newsgroup, you can
put them all in one big newsgroup, and then grow tired of reading one
big, unwieldy newsgroup.  The joys of computing!

@example
"^alt\\.fan\\.andrea-dworkin$\\|rec\\.dworkin.*"
@end example

These newsgroups can be native or foreign; everything should work
smoothly, but if your computer should explode, it was probably my
fault.  (Including other virtual newsgroups in this one will probably
confuse Gnus, so don't do that.)

One limitation, however - all newsgroups that are included in 
a virtual newsgroup has to be alive (ie. subscribed or unsubscribed).  In
fact, if you include a newsgroup in a virtual newsgroup, and it was
killed, it will be subscribed automagically.

@node Mail

Gnus will read the mail spool when you activate the newsgroup.  The mail
file is first copied to your home directory.  What happens after that
depends on what format you want to store you mail in.

@vindex nnmail-read-incoming-hook
The mail backends all call @code{nnmail-read-incoming-hook} after
reading new mail.  You can use this hook to notify any mail watch
programs, if you want to.

Gnus gives you all the opportunity you want for shooting yourself in
your foot.  Let's say you create a newsgroup that will contain all the
mail you get from your boss.  And then you accidentally unsubscribe from
the newsgroup.  Gnus will still put all the mail from your boss in the
unsubscribed newsgroup, and so, when your boss mails you "Have that
report ready by Monday or you're fired!", you'll never see it and, come
Tuesday, you'll still beleive that you're gainfully unemplyed while you
really should be out collecting empty bottles to save up for next
month's rent money.

@node Creating Mail Newsgroups
@subsubsection Creating Mail Newsgroups

There are two ways of making Gnus read your personal, private, secret
mail.  One is pretty easy, and the other requires minor tinkering.

@kindex M-x gnus-group-make-mail-groups (Summary)
First the easy way: Type @kbd{M-x gnus-group-make-mail-groups}.  That
will create a newsgroup called @samp{mail.misc} that will contain all
your mail.

Then the hard(er) way.

@vindex nnmail-split-methods
Set the variable @code{nnmail-split-methods} to specify how the incoming
mail is to be split into newsgroups.

@example
(setq nnmail-split-methods
  '(("mail.junk" "^From:.*Lars Ingebrigtsen")
    ("mail.crazzy" "^Subject:.*die\\|^Organization:.*flabby")
    ("mail.other" "")))
@end example

This variable is a list of lists, where the first element of each of
these lists contain the name of the mail newsgroup (they do not have to
be called something beginning with @samp{"mail"}, by the way), and the
second element is a regular expression used on the header of each mail
to determine if it belongs in this mail newsgroup.

The last of these newsgroups should always be a general one, and the
regular expression should *always* be @samp{""} so that it matches all
mails.

You should always do a @kbd{M-x gnus-group-make-mail-groups} after
changing this variable to create all the newsgroups you have specified. 

@node Expiring Old Mail Articles
@subsubsection Expiring Old Mail Articles

Traditional mail readers have a tendency to remove mail articles when
you mark them as read, in some way.  Gnus takes a fundamentally different
approach to mail reading.

Gnus basically considers mail just to be news that has been received in
a rather peculiar manner.  It does not think that it has the power to
actually change the mail, or delete any mail messages.  If you enter a
mail newsgroup, and mark articles as "read", or kill them in some other
fashion, the mail articles will still exist on the system.  I repeat:
Gnus will not delete your old, read mail.  Unless you ask it to, of
course. 

To make Gnus get rid of your unwanted mail, you have to mark the
articles as @dfn{expirable}.  This does not mean that the articles will
disappear right away, however.  In general, a mail article will be
deleted from your system if, 1) it is marked as expirable, AND 2) it is
more than one week old.  If you do not mark an article as expirable, it
will remain on your system until hell freezes over.

@vindex gnus-auto-expirable-newsgroups
You do not have to mark articles as expirable by
hand.  Newsgroups that match the regular expression
@code{gnus-auto-expirable-newsgroups} will have all articles that you
read marked as expirable automatically.  All articles that are marked as
expirable have an "X" in the third column in the Summary buffer.

Let's say you subscribe to a couple of mailing lists, and you want the
articles you have read to disappear after a while:

@example
(setq gnus-auto-expirable-newsgroups 
      "^mail.nonsense-list\\|^mail.nice-list")
@end example

@vindex nnmail-expiry-wait
The @code{nnmail-expiry-wait} variable supplies the default time an
expirable article has to live.  The default is 7 - seven days. 

Gnus also supplies a function that lets you fine-tune how long articles
are to live, based on what newsgroup they are in.  Let's say you want to
have one month expiry period in the @samp{mail.private} newsgroup, a
one day expiry period in the @samp{mail.junk} newsgroup, and a six day
expiry period everywhere else:

@example
(setq nnmail-expiry-wait-function
      '(lambda (group)
        (cond ((string= group "mail.private")
                31)
              ((string= group "mail.junk")
                1)
              (t
                6))))
@end example

@node nnmail
@subsubsection nnmail

@vindex nnmail-active-file
@vindex nnmail-mbox-file
The @dfn{nnmail} backend will use the standard Un*x mbox file to store
mail.  The path of the mbox file is given by the @code{nnmail-mbox-file}
variable.  In addition, Gnus needs to store information about active
articles.  The file specified by @code{nnmail-active-file} will be used
for that.

@node nnrmail
@subsubsection nnrmail

@vindex nnrmail-active-file
@vindex nnrmail-mbox-file
The @dfn{nnrmail} backend will use a babyl mail box to store mail.  The
path of the rmail mail box file is given by the @code{nnrmail-mbox-file}
variable.  In addition, Gnus needs to store information about active
articles.  The file specified by @code{nnrmail-active-file} will be used
for that.

@node nnml
@subsubsection nnml

The spool mail format (@code{nnml}) isn't compatible with any other
known format.  It should be used with some caution.

@vindex nnml-directory
If you use this backend, Gnus will split all incoming mail into files;
one file for each mail and put the articles into the correct directories
under the directory specified by the @code{nnml-directory} variable.  The
default value is @samp{"~/Mail/"}.

You do not have to create any directories beforehand; Gnus will take
care of all that.

If you have a strict limit as to how many files you are allowed to store
in your account, you should not use this backend.  As each mail gets its
own file, you might very well occupy thousands of inodes within a few
weeks.  If this is no problem for you, and it isn't a problem for you
having your friendly systems administrator walking around, madly,
shouting "Who is eating all my inodes?! Who? Who!?!", then you should
know that this is probably the fastest format to use.  You do not have to
trudge through a big mbox file just to read your new mail.

any of the news available on that server, you have to subscribe to the
newsgroups you think may be interesting, and then you have to exit this

@node Summary Buffer Format
@section Summary Buffer Format

@vindex gnus-summary-line-format
You can change the format of the lines in the summary buffer by changing
the @code{gnus-summary-line-format} variable.  It works along the same
lines a a normal @code{format} string, with some extensions.

The default string is @samp{"%U%R%X %I[%3L: %-20,20n]%T %S\n"}.

The following format specification characters are understood:

@table @samp
@item N 
Article number
@item S
Subject
@item F
From
@item n
The name (from the @code{From} header field)
@item A
The address (from the @code{From} header field)
@item L
Number of lines in the article
@item I
Indentation based on thread level
@item T
Nothing if the article is a root and lots of spaces if it isn't (it
pushes everything after it off the screen)
@item C
Current article
@item U
Unread
@item X
Expirable
@item R
Replied
@item x
Xref
@item D
Date
@item M
Message-ID
@item r
References
@end table

No elements are required, except the @samp{%U}, @samp{%R} and @samp{%X}
fields which have to be at the beginning of the line for reasons of
efficiency.  If you try to remove those, or change them, you'll probably
end up with a mess.

@vindex gnus-summary-mode-line-format
You can also change the format of the Summary mode bar.  Set
@code{gnus-summary-mode-line-format} to whatever you like.  Here's what

@item u
Number of unselected articles in this group
@item Z
A string with the number of unread and unselected articles represented
either as @samp{<%U(+%u) more>} if there are both unselected articles,
and just as @samp{<%U more>} if there are just unread articles and no
unselected ones.

will exit Summary mode and return to the Newsgroup buffer.  If this
variable is neither t nor nil, Gnus will select the next newsgroup, no
matter if it has any unread articles or not.  As a special case, if this
variable equals @code{quietly}, Gnus will select the next newsgroup
without asking for confirmation.  Also see @code{gnus-keep-same-level}. 

@vindex gnus-auto-center-summary
If @code{gnus-auto-center-summary} is non-nil, Gnus will keep the point

tidy, but if you have a slow network connection, or do simply not like
this un-Emacsism, you can set this variable to nil to get the normal

@vindex gnus-required-headers
Gnus determines which headers it should generate in outgoing posts by
consulting the @code{gnus-required-headers} variable.  This is a list of
headers that Gnus makes sure is present in all outgoing posts before it
tries to post them.

@vindex gnus-followup-to-function
@vindex gnus-reply-to-function
Gnus uses the normal methods to determine where replys and follow-ups
are to go, but you can change the behaviour to suit your need by
fiddling with the @code{gnus-reply-to-function} and
@code{gnus-followup-to-function} variables.

To take "reply" as an example: If you want the replies to go to the
"sender" instead of the "from" in the newsgroup "mail.stupid-list", you
could do something like this:

@example
(setq gnus-reply-to-function
      '(lambda (group)
        (cond ((string= group "mail.stupid-list")
                (mail-fetch-field "sender"))
              (t
               nil))))
@end example

These functions will be called with point in the buffer of the article
that is being replied to (or followed up).

@vindex mail-signature
@vindex gnus-signature-file
If @code{gnus-signature-file} is non-nil, it should be the name of a
file containing a signature (@samp{~/.signature} by default).  This
signature will be appended to all outgoing post.  Most people find it
more convenient to use @code{mail-signature}, which does the same, but
inserts the signature into the buffer before you start editing the post
(or mail).  So - if you have both of these variables set, you will get
two signatures.

@vindex gnus-post-prepare-function
In any case, @code{gnus-post-prepare-function} is called with the name
of the current newsgroup after the post buffer has been initialized, and
can be used for inserting a signature.  Nice if you use different
signatures in different newsgroups.

@vindex gnus-auto-mail-to-author
If @code{gnus-auto-mail-to-author} is non-nil, Gnus will send a mail
with a copy of all follow-ups to the authors of the articles you follow
up.  It's nice in one way - you make sure that the person you are
responding to gets your response.  Other people loathe this method and
will hate you dearly for it, because it means that they will first get a
mail, and then have to read the same article later when they read the
news.  It is nil by default.

@vindex gnus-mail-send-method
@code{gnus-mail-send-method} says how a mail should be mailed.  It uses
the function in the @code{send-mail-function} as the default.

@vindex gnus-prepare-article-hook
@code{gnus-prepare-article-hook} is called before the header fields have
been prepared.  By default it inserts the signature specified by
@code{gnus-signature-file}. 

@vindex gnus-inews-article-hook
@code{gnus-inews-article-hook} is called right before the article is
posted.  By default it handles FCC processing (ie. saving the article to
a file.)

(@code{gnus-summary-cancel-article}).  Your article will be cancelled.

Be aware, however, that not all sites honor cancels, so your article may
live on in some parts of the world, while most sites will delete the
cancelled article.

If you discover that you have made some mistakes and want to do some
corrections, you can post a @dfn{superceding} article that will replace
your original article.

@findex gnus-summary-supersede-article
@kindex S (Summary)
Go to the original article and press @kbd{S}
(@code{gnus-summary-supersede-article}).  You will be put in a buffer
where you can edit the article all you want before sending it off the
usual way.  

The same goes for superceding as for cancelling, only more so: Some
sites do not honor superceding.  On those sites, it will appear that you
have posted almost the same article twice.

If you have just posted the article, and changed your mind right away,
there is a trick yuo can use to cancel/supersede the article without
waiting for the article to appear on your site first.  You simply return
to the post buffer (which is called @code{*post-buf*}).  There you will
find the article you just posted, with all the headers intact.  Change
the @samp{Message-ID} header to a @samp{Cancel} or @samp{Supersedes}
header by substituting one of those words for @samp{Message-ID}.  Then
just press @kbd{C-c C-c} to send the article as you would do
normally.  The previous article will be cancelled/superseded.

@node Ticking and Marking
@section Ticking and Marking

There are four kinds of @dfn{marks}: Tick marks, process marks, read
marks and expiry marks.  

@dfn{Ticked articles} are articles that will remain visible always.  If
you see an article that you find interesting, or you want to put off
reading it, or replying to it, until sometime later, you'd typically
tick it.  However, articles can be expired, so if you want to keep an
article forever, you'll have to save it.  Ticked articles have a @samp{-}
in the first column.

Articles that are marked as read - are just that.  They have a @samp{D}
in the first column.  Unread articles have a space in the first column.

You can also mark articles as @dfn{expirable} (or have them marked as
such automatically).  That doesn't make much sense in normal newsgroups,
because a user does not control the expiring of news articles, but in
mail newsgroups, for instance, articles that are marked as
@dfn{expirable} can be deleted by Gnus at any time.  Expirable articles
have a @samp{X} in the third column.

Finally we have the @dfn{process mark}.  A variety of commands react to
the presence of the process mark.  For instance, @kbd{C-c C-v M-C-v}
(@code{gnus-uu-decode-and-view-marked-articles}) will uudecode and view
all artciles that have been marked with the process mark.  Articles
marked with the process mark have a @samp{#} in the third column.

All the marking commands understand the numeric prefix.

@node Customizing Threading
@subsection Customizing Threading

@table @code
@item gnus-show-threads
@vindex gnus-show-threads
If this variable is nil, no threading will be done, and all of the rest
of the variables here will have no effect.  Turning threading off will
speed newsgroup selection up a bit, but it is sure to make reading
slower and more awkward.
@item gnus-gather-loose-threads
@vindex gnus-gather-loose-threads
If non-nil, Gnus will gather all loose subtrees into one big tree and
create a dummy root at the top.  (Wait a minute.  Root at the top? Yup.)
Loose subtrees occur when the real root has expired, or you've read it
in a previous session.
@item gnus-summary-print-dummy-lines
@vindex gnus-summary-print-dummy-lines
If non-nil, Gnus will print those dummy roots described above.  It it is
nil, the dummy roots won't be printed, but the gathering will still take
place (if @code{gnus-gather-loose-threads} is non-nil, that is.) 
@item gnus-thread-hide-subtree
@vindex gnus-thread-hide-subtree
If non-nil, all subtrees will be hidden when the Summary buffer is

Sometimes somebody changes the subject in the middle of a thread.  If
this variable is non-nil, the change in subject is ignored.  If it is

@end table

@vindex gnus-exit-group-hook
@code{gnus-exit-group-hook} is called when you exit the current
newsgroup.  

@vindex gnus-use-cross-reference
When you exit the Summary buffer, the data on the current newsgroup will
be updated (which articles you have read, which articles you have
replied to, etc.) If the @code{gnus-use-cross-reference} variable is
non-nil, articles that are cross-referenced to this newsgroup, and are
marked as read, will also be marked as read in the other newsgroups they
were cross-posted to.  This ensures that you'll never have to read the
same article more than once.

Unless, of course, somebody has posted it to several newsgroups
separately. 

One other thing that may cause Gnus to not do the cross-posting thing
correctly is if you use an NNTP server that supports xover (which is
very nice, because it speeds things up considerably) which does not
include the Xref header in its NOV lines.  This is Evil, but it's
common.  Gnus tries to Do The Right Thing even with xover by registering
the Xref lines of all articles you actually read, but if you kill the
articles, or just mark them as read without reading them, Gnus will not
get a chance to snoop the Xref lines out of these articles, and will be
unable to use the cross reference mechanism. 

@vindex nntp-xover-is-evil
If you want Gnus to get the Xrefs right all the time, you have to set
@code{nntp-xover-is-evil} to t, which slows things down considerably. 

C'est la vie.

@node Saving Articles
@section Saving Articles

Gnus can save articles in a number of ways.  Below is the documentation
for saving articles in a fairly straight-forward fashion (ie. little
processing of the article is done before it is saved).  For a different
approach (uudecoding, unsharing, digesting) see gnus-uu.

@vindex gnus-save-all-headers
If @code{gnus-save-all-headers} is non-nil, Gnus will not delete
unwanted headers before saving the article.

@table @kbd
@item o
@kindex o (Summary)
@findex gnus-summary-save-article
Save the current article (@code{gnus-summary-save-article}).
@item C-o
@kindex C-o (Summary)
@findex gnus-summary-save-in-mail
Save the current article in mail format
(@code{gnus-summary-save-in-mail}). 
@end table

@vindex gnus-default-article-saver
You can customize the @code{gnus-default-article-saver} variable to make
Gnus what you want it to.  You can use any of the four ready-made
functions below, or you can create your own. 

@table @code
@item gnus-summary-save-in-rmail
@vindex gnus-summary-save-in-rmail
This is the format Gnus uses by default, @dfn{babyl}.
Uses the function in the @code{gnus-rmail-save-name} variable to get a
file name to save the article in.  The default is
@code{gnus-plain-save-name}. 
@item gnus-summary-save-in-mail
@vindex gnus-summary-save-in-mail
Save in a Unix mail (mbox) file.
Uses the function in the @code{gnus-mail-save-name} variable to get a
file name to save the article in.  The default is
@code{gnus-plain-save-name}. 
@item gnus-summary-save-in-file
@vindex gnus-summary-save-in-file
Append the article straight to an ordinary file.
Uses the function in the @code{gnus-file-save-name} variable to get a
file name to save the article in.  The default is
@code{gnus-numeric-save-name}. 
@item gnus-summary-save-in-folder
@vindex gnus-summary-save-in-folder
Save the article to an MH folder using @code{rcvstore} from the MH
library.
@end table

All of these functions, except for the last one, will save the article
in the @code{gnus-article-save-directory}, which is initialized from the
@samp{SAVEDIR} environment variable.

As you can see above, the functions use different functions to find a
suitable name of a file to save the article in.  Below is a list of
available functions that generates names:

@table @code
@item gnus-Numeric-save-name
@findex gnus-Numeric-save-name
Generates file names that look like @samp{~/News/Alt.andrea-dworkin/45}.
@item gnus-numeric-save-name
@findex gnus-numeric-save-name
Generates file names that look like @samp{~/News/alt.andrea-dworkin/45}.
@item gnus-Plain-save-name
@findex gnus-Plain-save-name
Generates file names that look like @samp{~/News/Alt.andrea-dworkin}.
@item gnus-plain-save-name
@findex gnus-plain-save-name
Generates file names that look like @samp{~/News/alt.andrea-dworkin}.
@end table

@vindex gnus-use-long-file-name
Finally, you have the @code{gnus-use-long-file-name} variable.  If it is
nil, all the preceding functions will replace all periods (@samp{.}) in
the newsgroup names with slashes (@samp{/}) - which means that the
functions will generate hierarchies of directories instead of having all
the files in the toplevel directory (@samp{~/News/alt/andrea-dworkin}
instead of @samp{~/News/alt.andrea-dworkin}.)

@node Decoding Articles
@section Decoding Articles

Gnus has a plethora of functions for handling series of (uu)encoded
articles.  Gnus can find out by itself what articles belong to one
series, decode all the articles and unpack/view/save the resulting
file(s).  All these functions belong to the `gnus-uu' package and are
reached from the Summary buffer as three-key keystrokes: @key{C-c C-v
KEY}.  That last key varies, of course, but all these functions use the
@key{C-c C-v} prefix keystroke.

Gnus guesses what articles are in the series according to the following
simplish rule: The subjects must be (nearly) identical, except for the
last two numbers of the line.  (Spaces are largely ignored, however.)

For example: If you choose a subject called @samp{cat.gif (2/3)}, Gnus
will find all the articles that match the regexp @samp{^cat.gif
([0-9]+/[0-9]+).*$}.  

Subjects that are nonstandard, like @samp{cat.gif (2/3) Part 6 of a
series}, will not be properly recognized by any of the automatic viewing
commands, and you have to mark the articles manually with @key{#}.

The @code{gnus-uu-decode-and-save-all-marked-files} need some

@node Viewing Files
@subsection Viewing Files

When using the view commands, @code{gnus-uu-decode-and-view} for
instance, Gnus will (normally, see below) try to view the file according
to the rules given in @code{gnus-uu-default-view-rules} and
@code{gnus-uu-user-view-rules}.  If it recognizes the file, it will
display it immediately.  If the file is some sort of archive, Gnus will
attempt to unpack the archive and see if any of the files in the archive
can be viewed.  For instance, if you have a gzipped tar file
@file{pics.tar.gz} containing the files @file{pic1.jpg} and
@file{pic2.gif}, Gnus will uncompress and detar the main file, and then
view the two pictures.  This unpacking process is recursive, so if the
archive contains archives of archives, it'll all be unpacked.

If the view command doesn't recognise the file type, or can't view it
because you don't have the viewer, or can't view *any* of the files in
the archive, the user will be asked if she wishes to have the file saved
somewhere.  Note that if the decoded file is an archive, and Gnus
manages to view some of the files in the archive, it won't tell the user
that there were some files that were unviewable.  Try interactive view
for a different approach.

@node Rule Variables
@subsubsection Rule Variables

Gnus uses @dfn{rule} variables to decide how to view a file.  All these
variables are on the form
  
@example
      (list '(regexp1 command2)
            '(regexp2 command2)
            ...)
@end example

@table @code
@item gnus-uu-user-view-rules
@vindex gnus-uu-user-view-rules
This variable is consulted first when viewing files.  If you wish to use,
for instance, @code{sox} to convert an @samp{.au} sound file, you could
say something like:
@example
       (setq gnus-uu-user-view-rules
         (list '(\"\\\\.au$\" \"sox %s -t .aiff > /dev/audio\")))
@end example
@item gnus-uu-user-view-rules-end
@vindex gnus-uu-user-view-rules-end
This variable is consulted if Gnus couldn't make any matches from the
user and default view rules.
@item gnus-uu-user-interactive-view-rules
@vindex gnus-uu-user-interactive-view-rules
This is the variable used instead of @code{gnus-uu-user-view-rules}
when in interactive mode.
@item gnus-uu-user-interactive-view-rules-end
@vindex gnus-uu-user-interactive-view-rules-end
This variable is used instead of @code{gnus-uu-user-view-rules-end} when
in interactive mode.
@item gnus-uu-user-archive-rules
@vindex gnus-uu-user-archive-rules
This variable can be used to say what comamnds should be used to unpack
archives.
@end table

@node Other Decode Variables
@subsubsection Other Decode Variables

@table @code
@item gnus-uu-ignore-files-by-name
@vindex gnus-uu-ignore-files-by-name
Files with name matching this regular expression won't be viewed.

@item gnus-uu-ignore-files-by-type
@vindex gnus-uu-ignore-files-by-type
Files with a MIME type matching this variable won't be viewed.  Note
that Gnus tries to guess what type the file is based on the
name.  gnus-uu is not a MIME package, so this is slightly kludgy.

@item gnus-uu-tmp-dir
@vindex gnus-uu-tmp-dir
Where gnus-uu does its work.

@item gnus-uu-do-not-unpack-archives
@vindex gnus-uu-do-not-unpack-archives
Non-nil means that gnus-uu won't peek inside archives looking for files
to dispay.

@item gnus-uu-view-and-save
@vindex gnus-uu-view-and-save
Non-nil means that the user will always be asked to save a file after
viewing it.

@item gnus-uu-asynchronous
@vindex gnus-uu-asynchronous
Non-nil means that files will be viewed asynchronously.  This can be
useful if you're viewing long @file{.mod} files, for instance, which
often takes several minutes.  Note, however, that since gnus-uu doesn't
ask, and if you are viewing an archive with lots of viewable files,
you'll get them all up more or less at once, which can be confusing, to
say the least.  To get gnus-uu to ask you before viewing a file, set the
@code{gnus-uu-ask-before-view} variable.

@item gnus-uu-ask-before-view
@vindex gnus-uu-ask-before-view
Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ask you before viewing each file.

@item gnus-uu-ignore-default-view-rules
@vindex gnus-uu-ignore-default-view-rules
Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ignore the default viewing rules.

@item gnus-uu-ignore-default-archive-rules
@vindex gnus-uu-ignore-default-archive-rules
Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ignore the default archive unpacking
commands.

@item gnus-uu-kill-carriage-return
@vindex gnus-uu-kill-carriage-return
Non-nil means that gnus-uu will strip all carriage returns from
articles.

@item gnus-uu-unmark-articles-not-decoded
@vindex gnus-uu-unmark-articles-not-decoded
Non-nil means that gnus-uu will mark articles that were unsuccessfully
decoded as unread.

@item gnus-uu-output-window-height
@vindex gnus-uu-output-window-height
This variable says how tall the output buffer window is to be when using
interactive view mode.

@item gnus-uu-correct-stripped-uucode
@vindex gnus-uu-correct-stripped-uucode
Non-nil means that gnus-uu will *try* to fix uuencoded files that have
had traling spaces deleted.

@item gnus-uu-use-interactive-view
@vindex gnus-uu-use-interactive-view
Non-nil means that gnus-uu will use interactive viewing mode.

@item gnus-uu-view-with-metamail
@vindex gnus-uu-view-with-metamail
Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ignore the viewing commands defined by
the rule variables and just fudge a MIME content type based on the file
name.  The result will be fed to metamail for viewing.

@item gnus-uu-save-in-digest
@vindex gnus-uu-save-in-digest
Non-nil means that gnus-uu, when asked to save without decoding, will
save in digests.  If this variable is nil, gnus-uu will just save
everything in a file without any embellishments.  The digesting almost
conforms to RFC1153 - no easy way to specify any meaningful volume and
issue numbers were found, so I simply dropped them.

@item gnus-uu-post-include-before-composing
@vindex gnus-uu-post-include-before-composing
Non-nil means that gnus-uu will ask for a file to encode before you
compose the article.  If this variable is t, you can either include an
encoded file with @key{C-c C-i} or have one included for you when you
post the article.

@item gnus-uu-post-length
@vindex gnus-uu-post-length
Maximum length of an article.  The encoded file will be split into how
many articles it takes to post the entire file.

@item gnus-uu-post-threaded
@vindex gnus-uu-post-threaded
Non-nil means that gnus-uu will post the encoded file in a thread.  This
may not be smart, as no other decoder I have seen are able to follow
threads when collecting uuencoded articles.  (Well, I have seen one
package that does that - gnus-uu, but somehow, I don't think that
counts...) Default is nil.

@item gnus-uu-post-separate-description
@vindex gnus-uu-post-separate-description
Non-nil means that the description will be posted in a separate article.
The first article will typically be numbered (0/x).  If this variable is
nil, the description the user enters will be included at the beginning
of the first article, which will be numbered (1/x).  Default is t.

the current group is fetched by NNTP, the parent hasn't expired and the
References in the current article are not mangled, you can just press
@kbd{^} (@code{gnus-summary-refer-parent-article}).  If everything goes
well, you'll get the parent.

@node Kill Files
@section Kill Files

If a @dfn{kill file} for the current newsgroup exists, Gnus will read it
just after having gotten the article headers from the server.

The kill files are files that may contain, in general, any elisp
functions.  However, it is most common just to put functions that either
delete or undelete articles based on their headers in those files -
in short, killing articles.  Hence the name. 

There are several commands reachable from the Summary buffer that
inserts commands for killing articles based on the current article.  You
can, for instance, ask Gnus to kill all articles with a certain subject.

If you get really irrirated with some annoying twit, you can kill the
author.  Note that the author won't literally be killed, unless, of
course, he has an SCSI Gun Extension fitted to his machine.

@menu 
* Summary Kill Commands::   Adding simple kill commands to the kill file.
* Kill Mode::               A mode for editing the kill file.
* Kill Variables::          Customize your killing.  (My, what terminology).
@end menu

One note: I have seen a few people confused about what killing an
articles really does.  Killing an article does not remove it from the
news server.  It does not inhibit other people from reading the
article.  It only means that you won't ever see that article, nothing
more.  To really remove an article from the news server, you have to send
a cancel message, which you can't do if you haven't written the
article.  (Well, you can, but that's Not Nice.)

then change the kill file and want to run it over you newsgroup again to
kill more articles, it won't work.  You have to set this variable to t to
do that.
@item gnus-apply-kill-hook

@end menu

@node Hiding Headers
@section Hiding Headers

The top section of each article is the @dfn{header}.  (The rest is the
@dfn{body}, but you may have guessed that already.) 

@vindex gnus-show-all-headers
There is a lot of information in the header - the name of the person who
wrote the article, the date and the subject of the article.  That might
be very useful, buf there's also lots of information most people do not
want to see - what systems the article has passed through before
reaching you, the message id, the references, etc. ad nauseum - and
you'll probably want to get rid of some of those lines.  If you want to
keep all those lines in the Article buffer, you can set
@code{gnus-show-all-headers} to t.

Gnus provides you with two variables for sifting header lines:

@table @code
@item gnus-visible-headers
@vindex gnus-visible-headers
If this variable is non-nil, it should be a regular expression that says
what header lines you wish to keep in the Article buffer.  All header
lines that does not match this variable will be hidden.

For instance, if you only want to see the name of the person who wrote
the article and the subject, you'd say:

@example
(setq gnus-visible-headers "^From:\\^Subject:")
@end example

@item gnus-ignored-headers
@vindex gnus-ignored-headers
This variable is the reverse of @code{gnus-visible-headers}.  If this
variable is set (and @code{gnus-visible-headers} is nil), it should be a
regular expression that matches all lines that you want to hide.  All
lines that does not match this variable will remain visible.

For instance, if you just want to get rid of the references line and the
xref line, you might say:

@example
(setq gnus-ignored-headers "^References:\\^Xref:")
@end example

Note that if @code{gnus-visible-headers} is non-nil, this variable will
have no effect.
@end table

@vindex gnus-sorted-header-list
Gnus can also sort the headers for you.  (It does this by default.) You
can control the sorting by setting the @code{gnus-sorted-header-list}
variable.  It is a list of regular expressions that says in what order
the header lines are to be displayed.

For instance, if you want the name of the author of the article first,
and then the subject, you might say something like:

@example
(setq gnus-sorted-header-list '("^From:" "^Subject:"))
@end example

Any headers that are to remain visible, but are not listed in this
variable, will be displayed after all the headers that are listed in
this variable.

@node Using Mime
@section Using Mime

Mime is a standard for waving your hands through the air, aimlessly,
while people stand around yawning.

MIME, however, is a standard for encoding your articles, aimlessly,
while all newsreaders die of fear.

MIME may specify what character set the article uses, the encoding of
the characters, and it also makes it possible to embed pictures and
other naughty stuff in innocent-looking articles.

@vindex gnus-show-mime
@vindex gnus-show-mime-method
Gnus handles MIME by shoving the articles through
@code{gnus-show-mime-method}, which is @code{metamail-buffer} by
default.  Set @code{gnus-show-mime} to t if you want to use MIME all the
time; it might be best just use the toggling functions from the summary
buffer to avoid getting nasty surprises (for instance, you enter the
newsgroup @samp{alt.sing-a-long} and, before you know it, MIME has
decoded the sounds file in the article and some horrible sing-a-long
song comes streaming out out your speakers, and you can't find the
volume button, because there isn't one, and people are starting to look
at you, and you try to stop the program, but you can't, and you can't
find the program to control the volume, and everybody else in the room
suddenly decides to look at you disdainfully, and you'll feel rather
stupid.

Any similarity between real events and this info page is purely
coincidental.  Ahem.

@node Customizing Articles
@section Customizing Articles

@vindex gnus-article-display-hook
The @code{gnus-article-display-hook} is called after the article has
been inserted into the Article buffer.  It is meant to handle all
treatment of the article before it is displayed.  By default it contains
@code{gnus-article-hide-headers}, which hides unwanted headers.

@findex gnus-article-subcite
@findex gnus-article-hide-signature
@findex gnus-article-hide-citation
Other useful functions you might add to this hook is
@code{gnus-article-hide-citation} (which hides all cited text),
@code{gnus-article-hide-signature} (which, umn, hides the signature) and
@code{gnus-article-subcite} (which tries to clean up the mess supercite
makes in The Hands Of The Mad.

You can, of course, write your own functions.  The functions are called
in the Article buffer, and you can do anything you like, pretty
much.  There is no information that you have to keep in the buffer - you
can change everything.

@node Article Keymap
@section Article Keymap

Not many keystrokes are available in the Article buffer.  You would,
during normal reading, seldom put the point in that buffer.  All the
really useful functions are more readily available from the Summary

@node Misc Article
@section Misc Article

@vindex gnus-article-display-hook
@vindex gnus-article-prepare-hook
The @code{gnus-article-prepare-hook} is called right after the article
has been inserted into the Article buffer.  It is mainly intended for
functions that do something depending on the contents; it should
probably not be used for changing the contents of the Article
buffer.  Use the @code{gnus-article-display-hook} for that, which is
called after this hook is called.

@vindex gnus-article-mode-line-format
@code{gnus-article-mode-line-format} is a format string along the same
lines as @code{gnus-summary-mode-line-format}.  It accepts exactly the
same format specifications as that variable.

@vindex gnus-break-pages
The @code{gnus-break-pages} variable controls whether @dfn{page
breaking} is to take place.  If this variable is non-nil, the articles
will be divided into pages whenever a @code{gnus-page-delimiter} appears
in the article.  If this variable is nil, paging will not be done.

@vindex gnus-page-delimiter
@code{gnus-page-delimiter} is @samp{^L} (linefeed) by default.

possible @var{action}s - @code{newsgroup} (which is what happens when
you first start Gnus, or returns from the Summary buffer),
@code{summary} (which is what happens when there are no unread articles
in the newsgroup, and @code{article} (which is what happens when there
is an unread article in the newsgroup). 

We see that in the first two actions, the respective buffers will fill
the screen, and in the last, the Article buffer will take ten lines for
each three the Summary buffer gets.

@findex gnus-window-configuration-split
This variable can also have a function as its value.  In that case,
whenever Gnus tries to configure the Gnus buffers, that function will be
called with the @var{action} as its parameter.  There is one pre-made
function supplied, @code{gnus-window-configuration-split}, which may be
suitable if you have a very wide Emacs window, and wants to have the
Summary buffer and the Article buffer side by side.  Here's the
definition of this function, which you may use as a template for your
own function(s):

@example
(defun gnus-window-configuration-split (action)
  ;; The group buffer always exists, so it's nice to use 
  ;; it as a starting point.
  (switch-to-buffer gnus-group-buffer t)
  (delete-other-windows)
  (split-window-horizontally)
  (cond ((or (eq action 'newsgroup) (eq action 'summary))
	 (if (and (get-buffer gnus-summary-buffer)
		  (buffer-name gnus-summary-buffer))
	     (switch-to-buffer-other-window gnus-summary-buffer)))
	((eq action 'article)
	 (switch-to-buffer gnus-summary-buffer t)
	 (other-window 1)
         ;; Create and initialize the Article buffer if it doesn't
         ;; exist.
	 (gnus-article-setup-buffer)
	 (switch-to-buffer gnus-article-buffer t))))

@vindex gnus-updated-mode-lines
The @code{gnus-updated-mode-lines} variable is a list of buffers that
should keep their mode lines updated.  The list may contain the symbols
`group', `article' and `summary'.  If the corresponding symbol is
present, Gnus will keep that mode line updated with information that may
be pertinent.  If this variable is nil, screen refresh may be quicker.

@node Customization
@chapter Customization

All variables are properly documented elsewhere in this manual.  This
section is designed to give general pointers on how to customize Gnus
for some quite common situations.

@menu
* Slow NNTP Connection::      You run a local Emacs and get the news elsewhere.
* Slow Terminal Connection::  You run a remote Emacs.
* Little Disk Space::         You feel that having large setup files is icky.
* Slow Machine::              You feel like buying a faster machine.
@end menu

@node Slow NNTP Connection
@section Slow NNTP Connection

If you run Emacs on a machine locally, and get your news from a machine
over some very thin strings, you want to cut down on the amount of data
Gnus has to get from the NNTP server.

@table @code
@item gnus-read-active-file
Set this to nil, which will inhibit Gnus from requesting the entire active
file from the server.  This file is often v. large.  You also have to set
@code{gnus-check-new-news} and @code{gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups} to nil
to make sure that Gnus doesn't suddenly decide to fetch the active file
anyway.  Note that this will make it difficult for you to get hold of new
newsgroups. 
@item nntp-xover-is-evil
This one has to be nil.  If not, grabbing article headers from the NNTP
server will not be very fast.  Not all NNTP servers support XOVER; Gnus
will detect this by itself.
@end table

@node Slow Terminal Connection
@section Slow Terminal Connection

Let's say you use your home computer for dialling up the system that
runs Emacs and Gnus.  If your modem is slow, you want to reduce the
amount of data that is sent over the wires as much as possible.

@table @code
@item gnus-auto-center-summary
Set this to nil to inhibit Gnus from recentering the Summary buffer all
the time.
@item gnus-visible-headers
Cut down on the headers that are included in the articles to the
minimum.  You can, in fact, make do without them altogether - most of the
useful data is in the Summary buffer, anyway.  Set this variable to
@samp{""} or @samp{"^Date:"}, or whatever you feel you need.
@item gnus-article-display-hook
Set this hook to all the available hiding commands:
@example
(setq gnus-article-display-hook 
      '(gnus-article-hide-headers gnus-article-hide-signature
        gnus-article-hide-citation))
@end example
@item gnus-use-full-window
By setting this to nil, you can make all the windows smaller.  While this
doesn't really cut down much generally, it means that you have to see
smaller portions of articles before deciding that you didn't want to
read them anyway.
@item gnus-thread-hide-subtree
If this is non-nil, all threads in the Summary buffer will be hidden
initially. 
@item gnus-updated-mode-lines
If this is nil, Gnus will not put information in the buffer mode lines,
which might save some time.
@end table

@node Little Disk Space
@section Little Disk Space

The startup files can get rather large, so you may want to keep their
sizes down a bit if you are running out of space.

@table
@item gnus-save-newsrc-file
If this is nil, Gnus will never save @file{.newsrc} - it will only save
@file{.newsrc.eld}.  This means that you will not be able to use any
other newsreaders than Gnus. 
@item gnus-save-killed-list
If this is nil, Gnus will not save the list of dead newsgroups.  That
means that Gnus will not know whether newsgroups are new or old, which
makes automatic handling of new newsgroups impossible.  You should also
set @code{gnus-check-new-newsgroups} and
@code{gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups} to nil if you set this variable to
nil. 
@end table

@node Slow Machine
@section Slow Machine

If you have a slow machine, or are just really impatient, there are a
few things you can do to make Gnus run faster.

Set @code{gnus-read-active-file}, @code{gnus-check-new-newsgroups},
@code{gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups} to nil to make startup faster. 

Set @code{gnus-show-threads}, @code{gnus-use-cross-reference} and
@code{nntp-xover-is-evil} to nil to make entering and exiting the
Summary buffer faster.

Set @code{gnus-article-display-hook} to nil to make article processing a
bit faster.
