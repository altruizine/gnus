This manual was written by Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen (1968 --- ) who
resides in Oslo, Norway and poses as a student, but doesn't get much
studying done, for some strange reason or other.  When not worshipping
at the altar of Emacs, he can often be found slouching on his couch
reading while bopping his head gently to some obscure music.  He does
not have a cat.

Graphics and design by Luis Fernandes.  Set in Bembo.
