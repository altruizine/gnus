Thu Dec 29 08:20:42 1994    <larsi@redleaf>

	* gnus.el (gnus-summary-save-article, gnus-summary-pipe-output,

	gnus-summary-save-in-file, gnus-summary-save-in-pipe): Rewritten

	dummy roots.
	(gnus-group-describe-all-groups): New command and keystroke to
	list newsgroups descriptions for all newsgroups.
	(gnus-group-prepare): Removed tallying of articles in killed
	groups to speed things up to enough to be of any use.

	* gnus.el (gnus-check-first-time-used, gnus-find-new-newsgroups):
	Changed to really subscribe newsgroups that are mentioned by the
	"options -n" line(s). The variable

	startup.

	one tiny backwards compatibility issue.
	(gnus-select-method): This variable now lets you specify nntp port
	number as well.

	* nnmail.el (nnmail-request-move-article,
	nnmail-request-accept-article): Functions for moving articles. One
	can move articles between mail groups that use different select
	methods, which also makes these functions double as conversion
	routines.

	* gnus.el (gnus-open-server): All the low-level backend functions
	have been rewritten to make things cleaner and clearer. Most of
	the function calls have also been changed throughout the program.

	important.)

	structured. Added a few autoloads to kill the last few compiler

	dribble buffer.

	* nntp.el (nntp-open-server-internal): Further multiple nntp

	backends in use.
