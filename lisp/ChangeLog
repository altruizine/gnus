Wed May 17 19:38:43 1995  Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@surt.ifi.uio.no>

	* gnus.el: 0.71 is released.

Mon May 15 15:53:00 1995  Scott Byer  <byer@mv.us.adobe.com>

	* nnfolder.el (nnfolder-possibly-activate-groups) New function.
        nnmail-get-active returns a bogus list the second time around, so
        we want to make sure we only call it once.

	* nnfolder.el (nnfolder-active-number) Mase things a little more
        paranoid in the case where we enter this procedure from splitting
        mail - it will do a possibly-change-group, which, if
        nnfolder-use-active-file is nil, will figure out the _true_ active
        numbers from the nnfolder mail file.
